9.6 Exercises -- OOP ACTIVITY 8
9.6.1 - Defining Terms
1. class is like a blueprint of a program
2.object is like a blueprint for creating a blueprint 
3.instantiate is like a process of create a keyword of an objecy from a class.
4.Instance Variable is a non static variable because they are created separately.
5. Instance Method - are non static method because theya re created separately.
6. Class Variables or static member variable - are variables that are static and belong to the class itself.
7. Constructor - are functions that is being called when the class is being executed.

# 9.6.2 Java Scavenger Hunt

1. Look for a method that checks if a certain String ends with a certain suffix. For
example, if the given string is "Hello", the method should return true the suffix given
is "lo", and false if the given suffix is "alp"

## boolean public static endsWith()

Sample Usage :

String VarStr = "Hello"

System.out.println(VarStr.endsWith("lo"));
//output value is true
System.out.println(VarStr.endsWith("ple"));
//ouput val is false

2. Look for the method that determines the character representation for a specific digit
in the specified radix. For example, if the input digit is 15, and the radix is 16, the
method would return the character F, since F is the hexadecimal representation for
the number 15 (base 10)

## public static char forDigit(int digit, int radix)  

Sample Usage :
char valChar= Character.forDigit(15,16);
System.out.print(valChar);
//output is false

3. Look for the method that terminates the currently running Java Virtual Machine

## public static void exit(int status)

Sample Usage :

System.exit(0);
//exits the program silently


4. Look for the method that gets the floor of a double value. For example, if I input a
3.13, the method should return the value 3.

## public static double floor(double a)

double myVal = Math.floor(3.13);
System.out.println(myVal);
//output is 3.


5. Look for the method that determines if a certain character is a digit. For example, if I
input '3', it returns the value true.

## public static boolean isDigit(char ch)

Sample Usage :

boolean valDigit = Character.isDigit('3')
System.out.println(valDigit);
//output is true
